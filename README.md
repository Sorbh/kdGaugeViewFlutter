# Motivation

I need some clean Guage view for my Flutter application.

# Getting started

## Installing
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

This library is posted in pub.dev

#### pubspec.yaml
```dart
dependencies:  
	kdgaugeview: ^1.0.4
```

# Usage

After Importing this library, you can directly use this view in your Widget tree

```dart
import  'package:kdgaugeview/kdgaugeview.dart';
```

```
 GlobalKey<KdGaugeViewState> key = GlobalKey<KdGaugeViewState>();
```

```dart
KdGaugeView(
    key: key,
    minSpeed: 0,
    maxSpeed: 180,
    speed: 70,
    animate: true,
)
```
Update the speed of the Gauge View using this method

```
key.currentState.updateSpeed(120, animate: true,duration: Duration(milliseconds: 400));
```

# Customization
  Depending on your view you may want to tweak the UI. For now you can these custom attributes

  | Property | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | 'speed' | double | Initial speed for the Gauge |
  | 'speedTextStyle' | TextStyle | Text Style for Speed Text |
